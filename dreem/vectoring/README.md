# DREEM Vectoring Module
Contributor: Matty Allan, Yves Martin

## Purpose
- Convert mapped reads into mutation vectors


## Interface

### Input Files
- [=1] ```{reference}.fasta``` Sequence record file that contains the names and sequences of all references.
- [≥1] ```{sample}``` Sequence alignment map files folder(s) generated by ```alignment```. Its content is the following:
```
/{sample}
  construct_x.bam
  construct_x.bam.bai
  construct_x_fastqc_report.txt
  ...
```

### Output Files
- [≥1] ```{out_dir}/output/vectoring/{sample}/report.txt```
- [≥1] ```{out_dir}/output/vectoring/{sample}/{construct_x}.orc``` 

### Command-line usage
```dreem-vectoring -fa reference.fasta -bam path/to/sample_bam```
- [=1] ```-fa```: The reference names and sequences.
- [≥1] ```-bam```: Sequence alignment map files folder(s) generated by ```alignment```.
- [≥0] ```-c ref first last```: First and last coordinates for reference ref (creates one mutational profile); using 0 for last is shorthand for the last coordinate of the sequnce, -1 for the second-to-last, and so on.
- [≥0] ```-p ref fwd rev```: Forward and reverse primers for reference ref (creates one mutational profile)
- [≤1] ```--fill```: For every reference in ```reference.fasta``` that was not explicitly specified using a ```-c``` or ```-p``` option, create a mutational profile for the entire sequence. Note: if none of ```-c```, ```-p``` or ```--fill``` are given, then no mutational profiles will be generated.
- [≤1] ```-P```: Parallelize the processing of mutational ```profiles``` or process each profile in series and parallelize processing ```reads``` within each profile, turn all paralleization ```off```, or (default) ```auto```matically choose "reads" if processing 1 profile, otherwise "profiles".
